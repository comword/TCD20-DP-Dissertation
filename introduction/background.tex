%COVID-19 impacts education
COVID-19 has brought great challenges to higher education and has inevitably changed the methods of teaching and evaluation.

%Deep learning technologies are widely used, applications
In recent years, ubiquitous influences of deep learning methods have brought tremendous advancement to many computer science fields and individual's daily life.

%Deep learning technologies are research hot-spot
The research of deep learning is a hot topic in contemporary computer science fields.
The design concepts between different deep models are also mutually influential.
Especially while convolutional neural network (CNN) is in the ascendant among the fields of computer vision, transformer model composed of self-attention structures has achieved state-of-the-art results in many natural language processing tasks.
The transformer model gradually replaced the recurrent neural network (RRN) with sequential computing restriction and long-term memory loss issues.
Innovative design concepts from the transformer model are also carried forward in the fields of computer vision.
Many recent studies, such as Data-efficient image Transformers (DeiT) and Shifted window (Swin) transformers, have improved widely-adopted CNN-only models such as VGG and ResNet by introducing the self-attention structures to achieve better performance.

%Research motivations on auto exam proctoring

%Characteristics of human pose-based features
\citet{thrasher2011mood}
%Characteristics of video-based data set

%Link pose-based and video-based features
From posture analysis in single imagery to human activity recognition in sequential imagery, it combines pose-based features and video-based data.
For example, \citet{yao2016spatio} propose a paper on spatio-temporal feature extraction with a variety of application scenarios in automatic human activity recognition, such as video information retrieval, intelligent surveillance, and human-computer interaction.
In future research, they will enable the low-level engineered features to fuse with a deep learning framework.

%Deep learning relations, coherence to research aims
After the use of deep learning to process images has gradually deepened.
