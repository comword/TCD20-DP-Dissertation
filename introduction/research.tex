After clarifying the research background, the research question of this dissertation is summarised as the following:

\begin{quote}
    Is it possible to understand sequential human actions, using an on-device camera video input stream with deep learning technologies, to classify the actions of an exam attendee in respect of approved or suspicious behaviours to a high level of accuracy?
\end{quote}

In order to answer the research question, this research aims to achieve the objectives through the corresponding methods shown in Table \ref{tab:Research objectives}.

After completing the above objectives, this research will also evaluate the project outcomes, especially for model performance and other following aspects.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Model accuracy, precision and other evaluation metrics on the classification task.
    \item Balanced performance between accuracy and efficiency of the deep learning model.
    \item User experiences of the overall system.
\end{itemize}
