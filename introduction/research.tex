After clarifying the research background, the research question of this dissertation is summarised as the following:

\begin{quote}
    Is it possible to use camera video input and deep learning models on mobile devices to recognise and classify the actions of the exam attendee with a high recall rate?
\end{quote}

In order to answer the research question, this research aims to achieve the following objectives through the corresponding methods.

\begin{longtable}{>{\hspace*{-0.3cm}$\bullet$\hspace*{0.2cm}}p{.4\textwidth}p{.56\textwidth}}
To do the literature review & By surveying the state-of-the-art technologies of deep-learning-based posture analysis \\
To have an available data set & By obtaining a suitable image and video data set and labelling them for training the model \\
To design a deep learning model & By designing a deep learning model \\
To code and train the deep model & By training the model and fine-tuning hyper-parameters \\
To optimise the model for mobile & By developing a working mobile app that equips the model \\
\end{longtable}

After completing the above objectives, this research will also evaluate the project outcomes, especially for model performance and other following aspects.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Model accuracy, precision and other evaluation metrics on the classification task.
    \item Balanced performance between accuracy and efficiency of the deep learning model.
    \item User experiences of the overall system.
\end{itemize}
