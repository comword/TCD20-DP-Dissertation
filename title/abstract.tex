The COVID-19 pandemic has prevented students from congregating to take traditional in-person exams, shifting the attention of pedagogical institutions to online exam system accessed remotely. In this research, previous review papers on human action recognition are surveyed and confirmed the feasibility of obtaining pose-based features from spatiotemporal data sets such as videos. Aims to develop and enhance new concepts of online exams by using deep learning models of posture detection on PCs and mobile devices under the premise of achieving a balance between performance, function and resource demand constraints.
