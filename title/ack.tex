First and foremost, I would like to express my profound gratitude to my supervisor Associate Professor Ciar√°n Mc Goldrick, who has provided me with constant support and guidance through each stage of this dissertation. 
With his strict guidance and gentle encouragement from time to time, I complete this study with my effort and propose directions for future research.

I am deeply grateful to Trinity College Dublin and the School of Computer Science and Statistics for teaching me the theoretical foundation, practical techniques of computer science and innovative research methods. 
In addition, the use of web hosting services and the support of computing power have provided great help for data collection and model training in this research.

Last but not least, I am thankful to my solicitous parents for their warm cares and financial funding for supporting me in studying abroad and upholding my chosen academic path.
