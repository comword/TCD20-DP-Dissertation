After introducing the background and details of several deep models related to achieving the research goals, mobile device optimisation for deep models is another focus of this research.
To protect user privacy by running model inference on mobile devices with limited computing power means model architecture, computational and spatial complexity need to be optimised.
In this section, I will discuss the mobile optimisation research of deep models, especially the CNN and Transformers used in this research.
