The previous two sections introduce the model backbone related to the project and a series of optimisation methods that can enable models running on mobile devices.
This section will mainly explain the background of video-based human action recognition tasks and two deep-learning models that are mainly targeted to such tasks, namely 3D Convolutional Neural Networks(3D-CNN) and Transformer.
