Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence. Deep learning is also a branch of machine learning, which utilises artificial neural networks for feature learning and hierarchical feature extraction to replace manual feature engineering in other machine learning methods.
Recently, the research of deep learning is a hot topic in the field of computer science, and it is also an important method used in the computer vision task in this research.
This section will introduce the details of a variety of deep learning models related to this research, including CNN, RNN, attention and Transformer structures.
Although the applications or target tasks of these models are different, the design ideas between them are mutually influential.
Therefore, reviewing the development and design concepts of these previous models will greatly help the design of the model in this research.
