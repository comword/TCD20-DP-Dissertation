\subsection{State-of-the-art models}

Innovative design concepts from the transformer model are also carried forward in the fields of computer vision.

Many recent studies, such as Data-efficient image Transformers (DeiT) and Shifted window (Swin) transformers, have improved widely-adopted CNN-only models such as VGG and ResNet by introducing the self-attention structures to achieve better performance.
