\label{chap:Literature review}
This chapter firstly reviews the spatial features of human poses and the temporal features involved in the video data set, as well as the classic methods used to processing these features in section \ref{sec:Data features and classic methods}.
Then, section \ref{sec:Online exam security system} surveys the previous research and technical applications on the online exam security system, the application scenarios of this project.
Before studying the related research using deep learning, section \ref{sec:Deep models detail} studies the details of several deep models comprehensively.
After understanding the related concepts and basic operations and backbones of the deep models, section \ref{sec:Related works using deep models} reviews numerous human activity recognition related works based on deep learning models.
Finally, section \ref{sec:Mobile device optimisation} mentions some methods of optimising models so that it can run on devices with limited computing power such as mobile phones.
