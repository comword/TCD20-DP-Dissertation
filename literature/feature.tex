%Link pose-based and video-based features
From posture analysis in single imagery to human activity recognition in sequential imagery, it combines pose-based features and video-based data.
For example, \citet{yao2016spatio} propose a paper on spatio-temporal feature extraction with a variety of application scenarios in automatic human activity recognition, such as video information retrieval, intelligent surveillance, and human-computer interaction.
In future research, they will enable the low-level engineered features to fuse with a deep learning framework.
