\section{Mobile app evaluation}
\label{sec:Mobile app evaluation}
Since this study has the research scope of mobile platforms, experimenting with computation performance evaluation is necessary to show the deep model is optimised to run inference on mobile devices.
The experiment in this research uses two mobile phone models from OnePlus.
The first is the OnePlus 5, a bit old phone released in June 2017, and the second is the OnePlus 8, one of the top phones from last year, unveiled on April 14, 2020.
Table \ref{tab:Experiment results on mobile devices} shows the hardware details of these phones with the experiment results of average frame rate expressed in frames per second (FPS) metric.

The result from the OnePlus 8 shows that the mobile app runs fast and smoothly on the high-end phone manufactured last year.
Therefore, from 2021 and in the future, there will be no hardware performance barriers for mobile phones to running the deep model implemented in this study.

As for the result from the OnePlus 5, an old mobile phone released four years ago, the frame rate result is lower than the result from the OnePlus 8.
Although users of old mobile phones may feel that the camera display in the app is a little lag and delayed, it does not crash or affect the user operation, UI response effect and the deep model inference because of the well-designed multi-threading architecture in the mobile app.
Besides, exam attendees should not stare at or operate the invigilating mobile phone during the exam, slight lag and delay in the camera display affect nothing in the practical use case.
As a result, a little old phones should be able to run the app as well.

TODO planned the user survey, different devices
