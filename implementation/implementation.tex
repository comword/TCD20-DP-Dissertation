After designing the overall system, the next step is to program and implement the system.
In order to use simple and suitable technologies to efficiently develop and coding required system functions before writing the actual code, the first step will select technical frameworks and libraries to implement the system in section \ref{sec:Framework selection}.

After determining frameworks, the rest of this chapter will introduce three system modules, the data collection app developed with on web technology in section \ref{sec:Capture and data collection web app}, the implementation of the deep learning model and adapting the model to the mobile app on Android in section \ref{sec:Mobile application}.
