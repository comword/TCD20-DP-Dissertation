\section{Data set collection}
\label{sec:Data set collection}
In section \ref{sec:Data features and classic methods}, I have reviewed feature engineering and classic machine learning models before deep learning was widely used.
They are extremely helpful for designing data sets collection guidelines for human action recognition tasks and designing a deep model.

\subsection{Requirements of data set}
The main difficulty of human action recognition tasks is exactly the same difficulty in the superset of them -- video understanding.

It is difficult to obtain enough data in both number and quality to train deep-learning models, especially for a video data set.

There are many public data sets for video understanding, but unfortunately, none of them has the video types needed within the research objectives.
