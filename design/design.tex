After reviewing related previous studies, this chapter will discuss various possible designs before actual implementation according to project requirements.

Firstly, the design of the data collection process is introduced in section \ref{sec:Data set collection}, including the data type to be collected, the labelling approach and the functionalities that need to be implemented in the data collection app.

Secondly, it is necessary to design the data preprocessing pipeline in section \ref{sec:Data preprocessing} according to the anonymity requirement detailed in research ethics (section \ref{sec:Research ethics}), and transform the data to make it suitable for model input.

Thirdly, the design of a deep model suitable for solving the problem of this research is detailed in section \ref{sec:Deep model design}, based on the related previous research and the background of deep models.
